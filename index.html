  <h1>How to Efficiently Merge Arrays in JavaScript</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The safest approach is to use the concat method of an Array object to
      merge two Arrays.
    </li>
    <li>
      If speed is critical, you may consider using JavaScript’s spread syntax
      and the Array object’s push method for smaller Arrays.
    </li>
    <li>The spread syntax fails to work with larger Arrays. When testing with 100,000 elements, the spread syntax generated a RangeError with the message: Maximum call stack size exceeded. </li>
    <li>If you need to merge smaller Arrays the spread syntax can help you do this efficiently.</li>
    <li>For larger Arrays, with more elements, use the concat function.</li>
  </ul>
